# The Pernix Programming Language

Pernix is a memory-safe, system-level programming language.

## Highlights

- **Memory-safe**: Pernix is designed to be memory-safe by default. It leverages
 built-in static analysis that prevents memory-related bugs both at compile-time
 and runtime.  

- **Powerful Generics**: Pernix has a powerful generics system that allows you
 to write generic code that is both efficient and composable.

- **Powerful Type System**: Pernix has a type system that is both expressive and
 flexible. This enables catching bugs at compile-time and writing more robust 
 code.
